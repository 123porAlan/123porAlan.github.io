In the journey of life, it is common to observe how most people focus their attention on external factors to explain their circumstances. From morning traffic to job opportunities, there is a tendency to attribute events to chance or to forces outside our control. However, this perspective can cloud the understanding that, on many occasions, it is ourselves who, consciously or unconsciously, shape our own destiny.

When getting to know someone, we often discern between two fundamental types of people. On one hand, there are those who, despite facing adversities, seek to move forward without victimizing themselves. They adopt a resilient mentality, similar to the Japanese concept of "gambaru." This term goes beyond simply trying; it implies unwavering dedication until the final goal is reached. Gambaru means giving your all, without excuses or rest, until there is nothing left to give. It is a life philosophy that values perseverance and absolute commitment.

On the other hand, there are people who choose to victimize themselves in the face of every obstacle. These individuals tend to adopt a mediocre mindset, avoiding personal responsibility and denying their own mistakes. Carl Jung clearly expressed it: "People could learn from their mistakes if they were not so busy denying them." This denial not only impedes personal growth but also creates barriers to establishing meaningful relationships and surrounding oneself with positive influences.

From a philosophical perspective, this duality reflects the eternal struggle between determinism and free will. While some recognize their ability to influence their own destiny, others feel trapped by external circumstances. The choice of how to interpret and respond to life's events defines our essence and our path.

In conclusion, the mindset we adopt is a crucial factor that determines our success and well-being. Surrounding ourselves with people who value personal responsibility and perseverance can inspire us to develop a stronger and more resilient mentality. In the end, true transformation begins from within, and recognizing our own power to change is the first step toward a fuller and more meaningful life.
